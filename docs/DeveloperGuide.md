## Introduction

Emeraldo is a simple app for users to manage their daily tasks, such as keeping track of deadlines and scheduling of events.
This app is catered for folks who can type fast and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands.
It is also a Java desktop application that has a GUI.
<br>
This guide describes the design and implementation of Emeraldo.
Through this guide, you will gain an understanding how Emeraldo works and how you can further contribute to its development.

<br>
## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse
(Follow the guide from step 2 onwards given in [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace

<br>
#### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the setup to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project setup process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes

<br>
#### Troubleshooting

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
<br>
* _Reason_: Eclipse fails to recognise new files that appeared due to the Git pull. 
* _Solution_: you have to refresh the project in Eclipse:<br> 
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`.
  
**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
<br>
* _Reason_: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import. 
* _Solution_: you have to refresh the libraries by [running tests using Gradle](UsingGradle.md) once.

<br> 
## Design

### Section A - Architecture
<br>
You may wish to walk through a **quick overview** of our components and how they interact with each other in section A of this chapter. The 4 main components (**UI, Logic, Model, Storage**) will be explained in details in section B.

<br>
<img src="images/UML_Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
<br>

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above provides an overview of the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It has 2 responsibilities:
1. At app launch: Initialises the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
2. At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events. (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : Shows UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Executes the commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/UML_Logic.png" width="800"><br>
<br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.

<img src="images\UML_Seq1.png" width="800">

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `EmeraldoChangedEvent` when the Emeraldo data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

<br>
 
The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.
<br>
<br>
<img src="images\UML_Seq2.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

Section B will elaborate more on each component.

<br>
##Section B - Understanding the component
###UI component

<img src="images/UML_UI.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
<br>

 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

<br>
### Logic component

<img src="images/UML_Logic.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.
<br>

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>
 
<br>
<img src="images/UML_Seq3.png" width="800"><br>
<br>

### Model component

<img src="images/UML_Model.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Emeraldo data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
<br>
<br>

### Storage component

<img src="images/UML_Storage.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Emeraldo data in xml format and read it back.
<br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.
<br>
<br>

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file.
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
<br>
  
### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):
<br>
<br>

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
* To run all tests, you can right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
 
#### Troubleshooting tests
 **Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**
 * _Reason_: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests. 
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
 * _Solution_: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described 
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

You can follow these steps to create a new release:
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 3. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file yor created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Emeraldo depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>
