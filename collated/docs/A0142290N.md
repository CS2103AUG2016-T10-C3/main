####Use case: UC01 - Add task


**MSS**


1. User requests to add task
2. Emeraldo adds task and confirms that user has added the task 
<br>  Use case end


**Extensions**


1a. Emeraldo detects task to have the exact same details as an existing task


> 1a1. Emeraldo shows error message: "This task already exists in the task manager".<br>
> 1a2. User changes the details of the task to be added <br>
	
Steps 1a1-1a2 are repeated until the data entered are correct.<br>
Use case resumes from step 2.
