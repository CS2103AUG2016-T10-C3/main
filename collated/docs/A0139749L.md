#### Centrallo
 **Strengths**
  * Supports email forwarding from your personal mail into Centrallo
  * Allows the creation of list, notes and checklist, where the notes and checklist can be filed under a particular list
  * Items can be tagged as priorities which is consolidated in a priorities
  * Notes, lists and checklists can be given different colours (7 to choose from)
  * Supports attachment of files (up to 25mb) to the notes
  * Offers 3 methods to sort the notes i.e. alphabetically, by created date and by updated date

**Weaknesses**
  * Only can move 1 note/checklist at a time
  * Limitations of 100 notes in total for a free account
  * Requires internet connection to access (no offline version)
  * No calendar view for a quick overview of all notes by dates
  * No quick overview of all notes in general (GUI highly resembles that of an email inbox - the notes occupy a narrow column on the screen with the rest of the screen occupied by the content of the notes)
