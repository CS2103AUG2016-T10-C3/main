# Manual Scripted Testing


## Loading the sample data

2. Place emeraldo.jar in your desired folder for testing.
3. In the same folder where emeraldo.jar is placed, create a folder called ‘data’.
4. Place the sample data (SampleData.xml) into the folder you have just created.
5. Rename SampleData.xml to emeraldo.xml.
